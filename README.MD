# Bertie’s Books – Web App

A simple Node.js and Express web application built in the **Dynamic Web Applications** lab to demonstrate connecting a website to a MySQL database, using EJS templates, bcrypt for password hashing, dotenv for secure credentials, and handling routes for dynamic data display.

---

## Overview

**Bertie’s Books** is a fictional online bookshop that:

- Connects to a **MySQL** database to store and retrieve data.
- Displays a full list of all available books.
- Lets users **add new books** to the database via a form.
- Provides a **search** feature to find books by title (exact and partial matches).
- Includes a **bargain books** page showing all books priced under £20.
- Allows users to **register** by submitting a username, name, email, and password.
- Hashes passwords securely using **bcrypt** before storing them in the database.
- Allows users to **log in**, comparing the supplied password with the stored hash.
- Handles users trying to register with usernames/passwords that already exist.

The application demonstrates full-stack integration - combining Node.js server logic, EJS views, SQL queries, form handling, bcrypt hashing, and secure environment variable management.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** with **Express**
- **MySQL** (via the `mysql2` library)
- **EJS** (Embedded JavaScript templates)
- **bcrypt** for password hashing
- **dotenv** for securing database credentials
- **HTML5 / CSS**
- **JavaScript**

## Installation & Running Locally

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create .env file**
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=berties_books_app
   DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   DB_NAME=berties_books
   ```
3. **Run the app**
   ```
   node index.js
   ```
4. **Open in browser**
   http://localhost:8000/

## Access Control Summary

Session-based access control was added using express-session. The redirectLogin
middleware checks whether req.session.userId is set. If not, the user is redirected
to the /users/login page.

Protected Routes:

- /users/list: Only logged-in users can view the list of users.
- /users/audit: Only logged-in users can view the audit log.
- /logout: Only available to logged-in users.

Public Routes:

- / (home page)
- /about
- /users/register and /users/registered
- /users/login and /users/loggedin

Testing:
When not logged in, attempts to access /users/list or /users/audit redirect to the
login page. After logging in, these pages become accessible. The logout route
successfully destroys the session and prevents further access to protected pages.

## Validation summary

Server side validation is implemented using the express-validator module.

Registration page (/users/register and /users/registered):

- First name: must not be empty.
- Last name: must not be empty.
- Email: must be a valid email address (isEmail) and is normalised.
- Username: length must be between 5 and 20 characters.
- Password: length must be at least 8 characters.

If any of these checks fail, the registration form is re-rendered with error messages and the previously entered data (except the password). This prevents invalid data being inserted into the database and improves user experience.

Login page (/users/login and /users/loggedin):

- Username: must not be empty.
- Password: must not be empty.

If either field is missing, the login form is re-rendered with clear error messages. This avoids unnecessary database lookups when the form is incomplete.

Book pages (E.g. /books/add):

- Title: must not be empty.
- Price: must be a number greater than 0.

This helps ensure that only sensible book data is stored in the database and prevents obvious input errors such as negative prices.

Pages without validation:

- Static GET pages such as the home page (/), about (/about), the user list (/users/list) and audit log (/users/audit) do not accept user input in forms, so no server side validation is required on these routes.

Overall, validation is applied to all routes that process user submitted form data, and is not used on purely read only or static pages where there is nothing to validate.

## dotenv

To avoid storing sensitive information directly in the source code, the application uses the dotenv module. This allows all database credentials to be stored in a separate .env file rather than inside index.js.

**How it was implemented:**

- Installed using npm install dotenv.
- .env file was created in the project root containing the database host, username, password, and database name.
- require('dotenv').config(); was added at the top of index.js to load environment variables.
- The MySQL connection pool was updated to use process.env.DB_HOST, process.env.DB_USER, etc.
- .env was added to .gitignore so credentials are never uploaded to GitHub.

## Audit Logging

To track login activity and improve security, an audit logging system was implemented. This records both successful and failed login attempts.

**How it was implemented:**

1. I created a new database table called `audit_log` containing:

   - `username` (the supplied email)
   - `success` (true or false)
   - `timestamp` (automatically recorded)

2. In the `/users/loggedin` login route, an INSERT query is executed after each login attempt:

   - On correct password → a record is saved with `success = true`.
   - On incorrect password or unknown user → a record is saved with `success = false`.

3. A new route `/users/audit` was added.  
   This selects all audit records and displays them in a simple table for review.

This feature makes it possible to view login behaviour, detect suspicious activity, and keep a basic audit trail of authentication events.
